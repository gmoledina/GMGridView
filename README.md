An iOS Grid-View allowing the user to sort the views in the scrollView and also to see the views in full-size by pinching them. 
This view is inspired by the UITableView and uses a datasource and delegates in order to get the data and interact with it.

The cells are reusable and are not loaded until required (only the ones visible on the scrollview are loaded). 
It is important to use the dequeue method to reuse the cell.

The best sorting style (swap or push) depends on personal taste and the frame of the grid; you can choose the one that suits you best.
Same applies to the layout strategy (vertical, horizontal, paged,... and more to come).

Many working examples provided in the demo app.

Let us know how this component works out for you!
New feature requests are welcome. (ping [@gmoledina](http://twitter.com/gmoledina) or [@steipete](http://twitter.com/steipete))
